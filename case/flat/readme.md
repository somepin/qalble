This case revision does not have a typing angle and is only compatible with the wired ItsyBitsy RP2040 MCU, since it does not have a cutout for the power switch or battery. The micro USB cutout was designed for [NetDot Gen10](https://a.co/d/ahsglc3), so thicker micro USB cables may not fit without editing or filing down the case.

To assemble, use 9 [M3x10mm self-tapping screws](https://a.co/d/eH68tDS). The 4 rubber feet cutouts are sized around [8.8x2.5mm](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256802432366448.html) ones.
